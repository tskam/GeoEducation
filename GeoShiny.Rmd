## Getting to Know Shiny
### Shiny's user-interface, *ui.R*

.large[
- The *ui.R* script controls the layout and appearance of a shiny app.  
    - It is defined in a source script name *ui.R*.
    
    - Actually, *ui* is a web document that the user gets to see, it is based on the famous Twitter bootstrap framework, which makes the look and layout highly customizable and fully responsive.
    
    - In fact, you only need to know R and how to use the shiny package to build a pretty web application. Also, a little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript may help.]

## Getting to Know Shiny
### Shiny's server *server.R*

.large[
- The *server.R* script contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your Shiny app.

- You are expected to:

    - know how to programme with R.
    - familiar with Tidyverse, specifically dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2
